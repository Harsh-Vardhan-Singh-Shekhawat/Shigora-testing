          What is Trade Finance?
        </h1>

        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
          Trade Finance is one of the investment banking instruments that helps
          you to bridge the gap between you and your export business working
          capital. Many companies do not indulge in the export of goods and
          services due to the challenge of working capital and the surety of the
          payment. We at Terkar Capital arrange international trade finance
          solutions for our clients so that they don’t have a working capital
          crunch and can easily explore the international market.
