          Bank Guarantee Facility
        </h1>

        <p className="py-4 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
          In the Indian traditional working capital format, Cash Credit (CC) and
          Overdraft ( OD) are the most famous and commonly known working capital
          facilities. However, over the period, the banking industry has
          developed many products. They have designed considering the
          characteristics of the nature of the businesses. Few of them are
          developed to build trust between buyer and seller. So, among the
          financial instruments, a bank guarantee facility has gained
          prominence.
        </p>
        <p className="py-4 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
          Generally, working capital facilities can bifurcate into two segments.
          One is fund-based and the other is non-fund-based. However, a Bank
          Guarantee is a non-fund-based credit facility. It is an unsecured debt
          funding instrument. Terkar Capital arranges loans against the bank
          guarantee.

        </h1>

        <p className="py-4 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
          To obtain a bank guarantee in India, applicants typically need to
          submit a duly filled application form along with KYC documents,
          business registration papers, and a board resolution for corporate
          entities. Financial statements, collateral documents (if applicable),
          and details of the transaction are also crucial. Legal opinions may be
          sought, and an application fee is usually charged by the issuing bank.
          Applicants should check with the specific bank for any additional
          requirements and follow their guidelines for a smooth application

          Process of BG Backed Transactions
        </h1>

        <p className="py-4 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
          Whenever the buyer and seller need assurance on the payment and
          delivery of the product or service bank guarantees come into the
          picture. Below is the standard process followed for the BG-backed
          transaction.
        </p>

        <ul className=" py-6 trackin-[0.7px] text-[17px]">
          <h3 className="text-black text-[20px] font-semibold py-4">Step 1</h3>
          <li>
            The buyer/applicant approaches the bank to issue the bank guarantee
            to the seller. The applicant provides all the necessary inputs which
            include, the amount, date, validity period, the purpose of the
            issuance, etc.
          </li>
          <h3 className="text-black text-[20px] font-semibold py-4">Step 2</h3>
          <li>
            Once the bank receives the required documents, it issues the bank
            guarantee to the seller. The bank may charge fees to the
            buyer/applicant. The bank will consider its mortgage/collateral
            before issuing the BG. If the requested amount is more than the
            bankâ€™s comfort, the buyer/applicant may need to arrange for more
            security deposit. circumstances, such as economic downturns or new
            taxation systems.
          </li>
          <h3 className="text-black text-[20px] font-semibold py-4">Step 3</h3>

          <li>
            Once the seller receives the BG from the Buyer, it confirms to the
            seller his assured payment. So the seller can start the execution of
            the order and delivery of the goods and services.
          </li>
          <h3 className="text-black text-[20px] font-semibold py-4">Step 4</h3>

          <li>
            When the seller has performed all the terms and conditions of the
            payments, the buyer has to make the payment to the seller. In any
            case, if the buyer refrains from making the payment or delays the
            payment, then the BG issuing bank is liable to make the payment
            without question to the seller. And if the buyer makes the committed
            payment, then the bank guarantee stands void.
