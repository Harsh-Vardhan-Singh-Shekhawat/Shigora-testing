All private debt players are RBI (Reserve Bank of India) and SEBI (Security Exchange Board of India) license holders. Lenders always make sure the funding should not violate any of the government or RBI norms. It is 100% safe and secure to borrow money.        ",

There is no hard and fast structure to be followed. The amount can be arranged in term loan format or maybe in other required formats, the term can be flexible, the repayment structure can be flexible, and the EMI structure can be flexible. So, in short, all the possibilities can be arranged as long as it helps the business to grow.",

As long as the client matches the expectations and meets the fund housesâ€™ criteria, there will not be any concern about the upper exposure limit. The fund houses can take exposure up to some thousand crores.",

However, there is always flexibility in the repayment of the debt. The lender may propose some equity. However, the terms and conditions are mutually agreed upon. Nothing goes forward unless it is mutually agreed upon by both parties.",
