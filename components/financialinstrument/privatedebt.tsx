All private debt players are RBI (Reserve Bank of India) and SEBI (Security Exchange Board of India) license holders.

There is no hard and fast structure to be followed. The amount can be arranged in term loan format or maybe in other required formats, the term can be flexible, the repayment structure can be flexible, and the EMI structure can be flexible.

          The banking system of any country is the major contributor to the Economy. Governments and Bankers always put the effort to carry out all the economic transactions through the banking system. The banking system works in a defined framework. And there are always some exceptions to the standard condition.

        <p className="py-4 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
        Private debt or Private Credit comes into the picture, where the business crosses certain operational limits and cannot fit with regular banking operations. Or there are certain scenarios of the business that bankers cannot fund. Private debt funding works in unconventional ways. Here are a few of the best conditions where and why alternative investments or Private Debt comes into the picture.
