            Since the order is huge and he is in lacks funds, he is thinking
            about what can be done for borrowing finance. The deal is going to
            make his company shine but the amount required for manufacturing is
            massive. Perhaps his CIBIL rating is creditworthy and hence can
            easily get a loan from any Bank, NBFC, or Financial Institution. As
            he is unable to make a decision as to whom to approach for the
            cause. While searching Financial Consultant he came across Terkar
            Capital. He approached us to fix a meeting to understand the process
            of availing a loan against property.
