        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
          John is an automobile parts manufacturer. He has a manufacturing plant
          in Pune and offices in many cities in India. Starting in 2010, John’s
          business has grown exponentially. His turnover is now Rs. 7.5 crores.
        </p>

        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
          John is starting to manufacture a new line of products in two months.
          While he is planning for the new manufacturing line, he realizes the
          issue of working capital which he may face. John will raise the
          invoice and his customer will pay it after a certain period of time at
          the decided due date, it takes 30 to 90 days to get the invoice paid
          by the client. John’s payment thus gets stuck and his working capital
          will be blocked till he gets his payment.
        </p>

        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
          But there are several challenges in the international market. The
          challenge of working capital, the challenge of the surety of the
          payment, the challenge of the credit period, and so on. Earlier, he
          had many times planned for the export, but every time he stopped
          because of these challenges. But this time he is very stubborn. And he
          was very much aware of the fact that businesses have to take risks.

          <p className="">
            This new manufacturing line is for a big company. Thus the working
            capital cycle is long and John’s cash flow doesn’t allow for the
            desired credit period. John is thinking about taking funding from a
            financial institution. But he realizes he has no asset or property
            which he can keep as a mortgage. Also, paying interest on the entire
            amount of the loan doesn’t seem convenient to him. Thus, he will be
            using the money until his customer repays him.{" "}

          <br />
          <p>
            John is very worried. While searching for financial advisory firms
            online, he came across Terkar Capital. He approached Terkar Capital.
            They set up a meeting with him to explain the process of bill
            discounting for manufacturing.{" "}

          We discussed his situation and his business requirements. After
          careful analysis of the same. We suggested to him, that we can arrange
          the debt instrument. So, that works well for working capital and
          without a mortgage. We suggested Bill Discounting Facility for his
          business situation. This was a perfect fit considering his
          requirements and his business. We explained to him the entire process
          of the bill discounting facility, before starting the procedure.

        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
          We then approached a financial institution for a bill discounting
          facility. John had good creditworthiness and the financial institution
          was convinced of the legitimacy of the bill. The respective financial
          institutions discounted the bill and the margin was decided as per the
          agreed terms. As per invoice financing, the financial institution has
          given the required exposure of Rs. 1.3 crores, which John can use as
          and when he raises an invoice to his customers.{" "}
        </p>

        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
          By MSME bill discounting John only had to pay interest on the amount
          of money he discounted. It is until that time period, he used the
          money. As soon as the respective financial institutions received the
          amount from the customer against the invoice, the cycle for charging
          interest stopped. So, John found purchase bill discounting very useful
          and it gave more flexibility to his business.

        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
        Terkar Capital arrange the funding almost in CC format. Thus, the bill discounting limit was open for John. He could use the limit as and when an invoice was raised to the client. John could use the money immediately for working capital. Due to the bill discounting facility, he did not have to wait for 50 or 90 days until the customer paid him the invoice amount. The whole process of discounting bills of exchanges is carried out in 5 working days. Thus, Mr. John was super happy with our service and professional execution of the proposal.
