        <p className="py-4 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
        David runs a plastic manufacturing plant named “Perfect Plastics Private Limited”. He has been in the business since 2015. The turnover of David’s company is 37 crores for the last financial year. The company is rapidly growing over a period of time. He has now been approached by a large multinational company for a big deal. If this deal goes through, David’s company will earn major profits. To date whatever has been earned in the business, David has reinvested into the business. But the foreign company wants David to purchase advanced machinery to increase the productivity of his plant. This machinery will improve his business significantly. Thus, producing high-quality outputs as well. The machine will also save a significant amount of cost, time, and energy while generating profit. Let us see how Terkar Capital aids to get a machinery loan.

          This is a German Machine. This machinery is very expensive and David is thinking about how he can fund the machinery. The machinery which David needs for his company costs 7.5 crores (Including GST and installation). If he doesn’t purchase the machine, the deal may not go through as a bigger company is already trying to get the deal.

      David’s company has a good CIBIL rating as they have a good credit history. The company also has a steady and genuine cash flow which can be reflected in the company accounts. Unfortunately, David does not have any assets or property which he can keep as collateral with the financial institution. Thus, he realizes that he would require a machinery loan without security. The purchase is for at least 5 years at a moderate interest rate. He has good cash flow, but he cannot pull the money from the existing cash flow as this will directly affect the existing working capital and the customer’s delivery.

        <p className="py-4 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
        David is now worried and is looking after an unsecured loan for a machinery purchase. So, while researching financial consulting firms, he came across Terkar Capital. They are one of the leading Corporate Debt Consulting firms in India. He approached Terkar Capital and we set up a meeting with him.

        <p className="py-4 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
        Our team of experts examined the case and asked for companies’ financial statements. After studying the financials, we came to the conclusion to provide a Factoring Funding Solution to his company. The balance sheet had no asset for collateral but showed heavy Account Receivables i.e. more than the required amount. Mr. Ajit was unaware of the concept of finance like Factoring and was contented after getting assistance.
        </p>

        <p className="py-4 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
        Factoring is the financial instrument or debtor finance in which the seller sells its accounts receivable to a third party called ‘factor’ at a discount. There are three parties involved in such transactions: the customer, the debtor, and the factoring company. In simple words, it is the selling of unpaid invoices for the requirement of instant cash.

      How Terkar Capital assist to get a machinery loan? </h1>
        <p className="py-4 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
        Our executives understood David’s requirements. We analyzed the case in detail. After the analysis, we recommended him for Machinery Loan, Instead of going for any other unsecured term loan. A collateral-free machinery loan is a term loan for machinery. It is taken for purchasing machinery. It enables small and medium-scale enterprises to afford tools and other equipment for their use. The better is your machinery, the better the productivity. Hence the efficiency of a company.
