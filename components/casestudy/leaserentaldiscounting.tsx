          LRD Funding Process
        </h1>
        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
          Mr Jacod has been a proprietary firm for the last 20 years. Jacob
          recently gave his premises on lease for 5 years to the vast and
          renowned cotton clothing brand. His turnover for the previous year is
          Rs. 1.4 Cr. As his business is growing, the resources of proprietary
          concern stand short for him and need funds for expansion. He decides
          to convert his proprietary concern into a Private company that will
          make huge profits. Jacob thinks from which sources the funds will be
          managed. Having no collateral, it was difficult for him to get
          funding.

          <p className="">
            Jacob had all the ideas ready for expanding the business but what
            hampered him was his issue with funds. He consulted many people and
            the financial institution, but to no avail! Everyone was asking for
            collateral for loans. While going through the Internet, he came
            across Terkar Capital. And visited our website. He soon contacted
            our team and the meeting was immediately fixed.

        Jacob was worried about his problems with funds and started telling us
        his requirements. Our team understood his needs, and we asked him about
        the financials. After analyzing all the documents and areas of his
        business, we realized a strong point that Jacob owns premises that he
        has given on lease for 5 years. Our team studied the areas related to
        property and came to the conclusion that Mr Jacob can go for Lease
        Rental Discounting. We suggested Jacob, LRD, which is one of the
        convenient sources of funding. Also, the tenant or a lessee was a
        renowned brand in clothing.

        What is LRD Funding?
      </h1>

      <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
        LRD is a term loan that is provided to the borrower based on their
        income from the rented property. A major aspect that affects the LRD
        Funding process is the availability of rent receipts from the tenants.
        The tenant or the lessee here should be a renowned brand or corporate,
        etc.
      </p>

        Learn in detail about what is LRD Loan.
      </p>
      <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
        Furthermore, we undertook the valuation of the property and rental
        receipts and came to the conclusion that Lease Rental Discounting would
        best suit the client according to his financials. The funding went to
        the lending institution for sanction, and soon the funds were released
        to the borrower. The process was carried out smoothly by our team
        members and the funds were received by Jacob, which solved his issue for
        expansion. The ROI given was also reasonable. Jacob was delighted by our
        service and started his successful journey.

          We discussed with his principal banker and communicated that Rajan can
          use the Cash Credit facility as per his drawing power which was
          exposed to Rs. 15 Cr. Rajan then withdrew the desired amount. He used
          the same to execute his order. So, Rajan benefitted from the CC
          facility and was content with our service. Thus, From then onwards,
          Rajan became our regular client and consults us all about his
          companyâ€™s finances.
