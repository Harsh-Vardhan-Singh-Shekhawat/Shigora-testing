          The turnover of his company is approximately Rs. 5 crores. His business is growing for the last 3 years. This year his company received an order worth Rs. 1.5 crore from one international client. The order is approximately 30% of last year’s sales. And he has no plan to take any chance on this order.

      David requires funding of Rs. 50 lakhs. Being a 1st-time entrepreneur, he has no fixed asset backup yet. So he does not have any assets or property to keep as collateral with the financial institution. Thus he approached Terkar Capital for a solution, as we provide Unsecured Funding for IT Industry.
