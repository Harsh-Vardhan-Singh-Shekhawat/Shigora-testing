          Let’s Understand the Debt Syndication process from John’s case study.
        </p>

        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
          John is an entrepreneur. He owns a manufacturing company called ‘JB
          Private Limited’. He has been in business for 10 years now. The
          turnover of his company is Rs. 550 crores. John has one plant and an
          office in Mumbai. Now his business has been growing rapidly. He
          realized that he should open one more plant. Due to the increasing
          orders, his plant cannot take the load. Therefore, he decides to start
          a new plant in Pune, as the efficiency of his business increases and
          he will get more orders.

        <div className="p-5  shadow-xl">
          <p className="">
            While he is calculating and analyzing the amount of funding required
            for the business expansion he realizes that he needs funding of Rs.
            100 crores. One financial institution cannot lend such a huge amount
            of loan. He goes to different banks in order to get loans from each
            one. Soon he realizes this process is complicated.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            One of his business colleagues recommends he approach Terkar Capital
            for debt syndication services. John approaches one of us and we set
            up a meeting with him to discuss his requirements.

          Debt Syndication in Business Financing
        </h1>

        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
          During the meeting with Mr. John, our team understood the requirement
          of the amount, mortgage available, expansion plan, and expected rate
          of interest. After we understood his business situation and
          requirements, we were very clear the desired amount cannot be arranged
          from a single financial institution. We had to put in a couple of good
          bankers. So that can take partial exposure with pari passu. Thus, we
          informed Mr. John, that we will arrange the required funding through
          the debt Syndication facility.
        </p>

        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
          Debt Syndication meaning is that it takes place when a loan asked by a
          business or corporate is too large for one financial institution to
          lend. So, it is basically outside the scope of the lender’s
          risk-exposure level. Several lenders take the fund. A debt syndication
          loan is a structured product that is arranged and administered
          effectively. So, this is generally done by a third party or a
          consulting firm since there are many lending parties involved.

            We prepared a proposal for John’s loan and reached out to various
            lenders regarding the debt syndication process. After a week we had
            all the lending financial institutions, the documentation, and the
            soft approval ready. Once Mr. John was OK with the soft approval, we
            executed the whole operational process. So, we arranged the funding.
            He was very happy with our services and the execution of the entire
            process.
