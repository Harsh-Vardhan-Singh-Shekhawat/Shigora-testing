          Thus, David is thinking to take funding from a financial institution. If he takes the funding in rupees, which is very traditional, he has to deal with the Indian inflation rate and high cost of capital. This time while raising the funds, he is very much sure. So, he wants to arrange for the cheapest cost of capital. But David is still confused if any such facility is available for him in the market.

        Our team of experts examined the case and asked for companies’ financial statements. After studying the financials, we came to the conclusion to provide a Factoring Funding Solution to his company. The balance sheet had no asset for collateral but showed heavy Account Receivables i.e. more than the required amount. Mr. Ajit was unaware of the concept of finance like Factoring and was contented after getting assistance.

        <p className="py-4 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
        Factoring is the financial instrument or debtor finance in which the seller sells its accounts receivable to a third party called ‘factor’ at a discount. There are three parties involved in such transactions: the customer, the debtor, and the factoring company. In simple words, it is the selling of unpaid invoices for the requirement of instant cash.
