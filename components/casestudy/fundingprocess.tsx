        CGTMSE Funding Process (Case Study)
        </h1>
        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
        Robert, David, and John, college graduates and founders of RDJ Engineering Services Private Limited established their manufacturing business approximately 2.5 years ago. The company works in engineering goods manufacturing. As their business is expanding rapidly, they are in need of funding to buy new machinery and working capital. The cost of the machinery was Rs. 49 lacs (Including GST and installation). The remaining Rs. 26 lacs were required to purchase raw materials and other working capital.

      The Execution Process

        <div className="p-5  shadow-xl">
          <p className="">
          Considering their current requirement in mind, they approached their current banker. However, the current banker insisted on a mortgage, which posed a challenge for Robert, David, and John. And Robert, David, and John being the 1st generation entrepreneurs have not created the assets at that time. Whatever the profits they used to earn, they invested back in the business to scale it. This is shown in their last yearâ€™s turnover of Rs. 8.75 crores.

      After facing rejections from their existing bankers, they were a bit disappointed. They tried to get some advice from colleagues who are already in the business for the last couple of decades. One of them has suggested, Terkar Capital to them.
        </p>

        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
        Hence, they approached Terkar Capital and asked for financial assistance. Our executives analyzed their cases in detail and recommended them for Unsecured Funding under CGTMSE. This loan, a scheme of the government of India, is a perfect fit for their business in MSME growing faster but facing a working capital challenge because of a lack of collateral. Let us see CGTMSE Loan Process.

        After receiving all the required inputs from RDJ Engineering Services Private Limited, our team of experts took this assignment ahead. We arranged for the prerequisite and took the soft approval from a couple of financial institutions who can justify RDJ Engineering requirements from the current as well as long-term perspective.
        </p>
        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
        We executed the whole operational and documentation process in 3 working days. And at the end of the week (6th working day), we successfully disbursed the amount of rupees 49 lacs to RDJ Engineering machine vendor and opened CC exposure of Rs. 26 lacs, which RDJ can use as working capital. And the interest will be paid as and when the funds are used.
