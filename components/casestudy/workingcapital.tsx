          Working Capital Financing Case Study
        </h1>
        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
          Rajan Patel is running an automobile part-manufacturing company “Royal
          Motors Pvt Ltd” situated in Mumbai and Pune. He deals in manufacturing
          and selling spare parts for vehicles. He has been in this business
          since 2013. His turnover according to the financials of the previous
          year is showing Rs. 55 Cr.
        </p>

        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
          Thus, being well-known in the automobile sector, he has goodwill in
          the market. Now he is thinking of expanding sales all over India. So,
          for that, he needs funds for manufacturing spare parts. Meanwhile, he
          has received a new order and the funding requirement for such an order
          is Rs 13.4 Cr. Already, he has given his machinery for collateral. So,
          having no collateral, Rajan is confused about obtaining funds!!
        </p>

        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
          As per his current need, he went to many lenders for assistance. The
          lenders were ready to give a loan but against collateral only. So,
          Rajan was disappointed at getting no clues about getting funds.
          Searching for a fundraiser, he came across Terkar Capital. Thus, to
          avail assistance, he set up a meeting for working capital financing.

            We met Rajan and had a thorough discussion about finances. We asked
            him to issue his company’s financials for analysis. So, our team
            inspected the financials and advised him to go for Working Capital
            Loan. Let’s understand how Terkar Capital assists you in working
            capital financing.

        While analyzing the financials, we decided to raise the funds through the instrument of the Cash Credit facility of working capital financing. Cash Credit is a facility offered by borrowers’ principal bankers. Whereby, he is sanctioned a particular amount as per Drawing Power (DP) which can be utilized for making his business payments. The banker sets a credit limit for withdrawing the amount, and the borrower cannot cross that specified limit. Thus, the best part is that the interest is charged only to the extent of the money used.

        <p className="p-5 text-[17px] tracking-[0.7px]">
            We discussed with his principal banker and communicated that Rajan can use the Cash Credit facility as per his drawing power which was exposed to Rs. 15 Cr. Rajan then withdrew the desired amount. He used the same to execute his order. So, Rajan benefitted from the CC facility and was content with our service. Thus, From then onwards, Rajan became our regular client and consults us all about his company’s finances.
